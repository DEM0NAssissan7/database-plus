/* School grade database processing and display library

The goal of this project is to provide a standard where any school grade database can enjoy the features of database+.
This is for me when I go to college God willing, and the grades websites may suck, so I have to recode database+ for 
every website I want to use it.

Instead, this project will standardize all calculations, displays, features, and designs. All you would need to do to port it to
a new website is implement it and tell libdb what the grades/weights (and other things) are.

The end goal is to port peace academy db+ to this library in order for it to become monolithic and portable.
